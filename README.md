## Inspiration
When initially trying to figure out our project idea, we considered each prize category and how popular it would be. We knew ML, AI and CV would be highly popular, along with the supply-chain category and the Red Cross category. Thus, we chose to do a project based on the DeSo blockchain. 
We looked at some other apps using $DESO and found DiamondApp, Used DiamondApp, similar to Twitter, as inspiration for UI design and function.
## What it does
Crypto Mania is a plaftorm for gamers and game creators. Game creators can put their games on our plaform, and gamers can buy games with $DESO. By integrating the social networking aspect into Crypto Mania, we can foster a better community and discussion around games. **For example**, after a creator releases a new game, users could immediately try it out and give bug reports through our platform. All of this is on the blockhain, keeping the integrity of our plaftorm perfect. 
## How we built it
Languages used:
- Go - for blockchain backend
- TypeScript - for the frontend
DeSo's quickstart page contained a bit of sample code which we used to build a full-fledged product without extensive knowledge of Go. Their documentation made it easy to understand how to integrate the blockchain backend with our frontend. 
## Challenges we ran into
Installing the DeSo development environment, since the instructions were for Linux computers and two of us have Windows computers. We tried to use the Mingw Bash shell for Windows but it was too slow to get any meaningful work done. We also had challenges setting up the blockchain with the correct parameters to play nice with our frontend. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
* Setting up the environment for DeSo
* Figuring out how to make a dark mode
* Making custom logos
## What we learned
Two of us were complete newbies at TypeScript, and none of us knew Go either, so we learned a lot about those two languages especially through Stackoverflow! We also learned about how blockchains are actually implemented in the real world. 
## What's next for Crypto Mania
* Adding game embeds so users can try out games in the app
* Adding game NFTs for certain parts of the game
* Integration with pre-existing marketplaces such as Steam or the Epic Games Store
